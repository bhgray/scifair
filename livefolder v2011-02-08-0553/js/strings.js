Each game will consist of 16 rounds.</p><p>In each round, you will be able to bet any number of points from zero up to the amount you currently have.  Your score for each game will be the number of rounds you survived plus the amount of points that you ended with.  For example, if you lost on the 14th round, your game score would be 13 + 0 = 13.  Your total score is the sum of all ten of your game scores.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, the three users with the top scores will receive $10 each.</p>";
